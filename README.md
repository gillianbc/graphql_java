# graphql_java
Side by side I'm learning graphql for java as well as in node

Working my way through this https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-java/

Runs on localhost:8080 e.g. http://localhost:8080/graphql?query={allLinks{url}}

There is an open issue at the moment so cannot run the interactive playground - see https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_plug/issues/199
